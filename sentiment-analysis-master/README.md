# Sentiment analysis on the Movie reviews dataset

This is the mini-project for detecting sentiment of movie reviews, implemented using TensorFlow. The architecture of neural network used is RNN with LSTM cell.

## Dataset

If you want to test this RNN on the same dataset that I have used, you can find the dataset [here](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/si650winter11).

## Dependencies

> *  [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) 0.18.0
> *  [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) 1.10.4
> *  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) 1.5.1
> *  [String](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html)
> *  [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) 1.2.0
> *  [Collections](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html)


## Python version

The Python version that I have used in this notebook is 3.5. But 3.6 is supported as well.


## Code

The whole code for this mini-project is inside **movie_reviews_sentiment_analysis.ipynb**. 

## Run

To run this code you will need some software, like Anaconda, which provides support for running .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebook).

After making sure you have that, you can run from a terminal or cmd next lines:



`ipython notebook movie_reviews_sentiment_analysis.ipynb`

or

`jupyter notebook movie_reviews_sentiment_analysis.ipynb`
